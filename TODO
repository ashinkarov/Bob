* We do not have VAR_DECL nodes, and we do not copy variables, so basically
  we have a problem when we copy a function or even a statement list.

* We do not check for expressions, mostly because we do not have a good 
  solution for the type of list element.

* Type of a list element when we do indexing or for operation.


---------------------------------- DONE ---------------------------------------
* When atomic tree is allocated we would like to store it in a special list
  which we could free afterwards. This could simplify the mechanism of 
  freeing. Basically we use a primitive garbage collector, whihc is implemented
  as a hash-table of pointers.
